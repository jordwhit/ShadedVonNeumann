# ShadedVonNeumann

The Von Neumann set theoretical construction for any given natural number can be visualized by circles containing other circles. 
(learn more about such constructions here: https://platonicrealms.com/encyclopedia/Von-Neumann-Hierarchy) 

Each "element" of a given number is a smaller number. E.G. The set theoretical number 4 contains the set representations of 3, 2, and 1. 

This program visualizes any number of your choice. It also shades the numbers which possess a certain property of your choice. 

Right now, the program visualizes the number 7, and shades all numbers which are (prime OR even) AND not zero. 

To change the property checked, change the function "custom_property(n)"
